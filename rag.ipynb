Three reasons, I think.\\nOne is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers, and\\ncustomer service is not part of the training of engineers. You're\\nsupposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not be\\nslavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of\\nsalesperson. Ironically, part of the reason engineering is\\ntraditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date from\\na time when engineers were less powerful — when they were\\nonly in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather\\nthan running the whole show.

And incidentally, when it does,\\nyou'll ﬁnd that delighting customers scales better than you\\nexpected. Partly because you can usually ﬁnd ways to make\\nanything scale more than you would have predicted, and partly\\nbecause delighting customers will by then have permeated your\\nculture.\\nI have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by\\ntrying too hard to make their initial users happy.\\nBut perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing\\nhow attentive they could be to their users is that they've never\\nexperienced such attention themselves. Their standards for\\ncustomer service have been set by the companies they've been\\ncustomers of, which are mostly big ones. Tim Cook doesn't send\\nyou a hand-written note after you buy a laptop.

[ 9]\\nConsulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale.\\nBut (like other ways of bestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe\\nto do it so long as you're not being paid to. That's where\\ncompanies cross the line. So long as you're a product company\\nthat's merely being extra attentive to a customer, they're very\\ngrateful even if you don't solve all their problems. But when they\\nstart paying you speciﬁcally for that attentiveness — when they\\nstart paying you by the hour — they expect you to do everything.\\nAnother consulting-like technique for recruiting initially\\nlukewarm users is to use your software yourselves on their\\nbehalf. We did that at Viaweb. When we approached merchants\\nasking if they wanted to use our software to make online stores,\\nsome said no, but they'd let us make one for them. Since we\\nwould do anything to get users, we did. We felt pretty lame at the\\ntime. Instead of organizing big strategic e-commerce\\npartnerships, we were trying to sell luggage and pens and men's\\nshirts. But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do,\\nbecause it taught us how it would feel to merchants to use our\\nsoftware. Sometimes the feedback loop was near instantaneous:\\nin the middle of building some merchant's site I'd ﬁnd I needed a\\nfeature we didn't have, so I'd spend a couple hours implementing\\nit and then resume building the site.\\nManual\\nThere's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Paul.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Manual\\nThere\\'s a more extreme variant where you don\\'t just use your\\nsoftware, but are your software. When you only have a small\\nnumber of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by\\nhand things that you plan to automate later. This lets you launch\\nfaster, and when you do ﬁnally automate yourself out of the loop,\\nyou\\'ll know exactly what to build because you\\'ll have muscle\\nmemory from doing it yourself.\\nWhen manual components look to the user like software, this\\ntechnique starts to have aspects of a practical joke. For example,\\nthe way Stripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its ﬁrst\\nusers was that the founders manually signed them up for\\ntraditional merchant accounts behind the scenes.\\nSome startups could be entirely manual at ﬁrst. If you can ﬁnd\\nsomeone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it\\nmanually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then\\ngradually automate the bottlenecks. It would be a little\\nfrightening to be solving users\\' problems in a way that wasn\\'t yet\\nautomatic, but less frightening than the far more common case of\\nhaving something automatic that doesn\\'t yet solve anyone\\'s\\nproblems.\\nBig\\nI should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn\\'t\\nwork: the Big Launch. I occasionally meet founders who seem to\\nbelieve startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and\\nthat they\\'ll make it big if and only if they\\'re launched with\\nsuﬀicient initial velocity.

And on a tuesday, of\\ncourse, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to\\nlaunch something.\\nIt's easy to see how little launches matter. Think of some\\nsuccessful startups.

All you need from a launch is some initial core of\\nusers. How well you're doing a few months later will depend\\nmore on how happy you made those users than how many there\\nwere of them. [10]\\nSo why do founders think launches matter? A combination of\\nsolipsism and laziness. They think what they're building is so\\ngreat that everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.\\nPlus it would be so much less work if you could get users merely\\nby broadcasting your existence, rather than recruiting them one\\nat a time. But even if what you're building really is great, getting\\nusers will always be a gradual process — partly because great\\nthings are usually also novel, but mainly because users have\\nother things to think about.\\nPartnerships too usually don't work. They don't work for startups\\nin general, but they especially don't work as a way to get growth\\nstarted. It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to\\nbelieve that a partnership with a big company will be their big\\nbreak. Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that\\nwas way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting\\npractically nothing out of it. [11]\\nIt's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially. You\\nhave to make an extraordinary eﬀort  initially.

Instead we should try thinking of\\nthem as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable\\nthing(s) you're going to do initially to get the company going.\\nIt could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,\\nbecause now that there are two components you can try to be\\nimaginative about the second as well as the ﬁrst. But in most\\ncases the second component will be what it usually is — recruit\\nusers manually and give them an overwhelmingly good\\nexperience — and the main beneﬁt of treating startups as vectors\\nwill be to remind founders they need to work hard in two\\ndimensions. [12]\\nIn the best case, both components of the vector contribute to\\nyour company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get\\nstarted are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company\\npermanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about\\nuser acquisition when you're small, you'll probably still be\\naggressive when you're big.
