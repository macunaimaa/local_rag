Comparing TCB Scans' translation of One Piece Chapter 1098 to the Original Japanese Text

TL;DR: not much to comment on in this chapter; important ones imo are 1b, 3a, 9a, 14c.

Disclaimer: My intent is not to discredit the work of TCB Scans. I simply want to provide a more "transparent" understanding of the content as intended by and as provided by Oda Eiichirou, such that words/statements/dialogue/narration/etc. can then be interpreted based on the original Japanese text - a.k.a. more accurate direct translation but minus the localisation. I will go over differences which, in my opinion, have some important apparent and/or potential context lost in translation and I will comment some explanation; the comparisons without explanation comments are just for fun; there are of course other translation inaccuracies in the chapter as well, but they do not change the intended conveyed context or information, hence, I won't be including their comparisons; lastly, of course there are lots of parts translated accurately, as well. P.s.: while the official translation also has its imperfections, we can always count on it for precise spellings of the names of characters, places, and things.



0. Cover Page: 

- TCB Scans: Brook powering his electric guitar solo with an electric eel.
- Original:【「ブルックがデンキウナギの電気を使ったエレキギターでソロを弾いているところ」P.Nのだスカイウォーカー】
- Meaning: Brook playing a solo on his electric eel powered electric guitar - by Noda Skywalker

1a. Opening commentary: 
- TCB Scans: The expanding tides of revolution!?
- Original:【革命の勢力は拡大するもー！？】 
- Meaning: "Despite the expansion of revolutionary influence," 
- Comment: The low context nature of the Japanese language allows frequent projection of phrases as complete sentences. Nothing different, nothing to compare, just a tidbit.

1b. Iva's first speech bubble: 
- TCB Scans: Ve can't! Our hands are full... ...dealingk with the vounded at Goa!!
- Original:【ムリ！！ヴァターシ達「ゴア王国」でケガ人いっぱい乗せちまっチャブル！！！】
- Meaning: "Impossible!! We've got too many injured people from the Goa Kingdom on board already!!!"
- Comment: Not just having their hands full, but having the RA vessel boarded and filled with the injured from Goa, as seen in chapter 587.

- Original:【おーーーいくまちー！！帰ってきたよ！！下界へ！！】
- Meaning: "Heeey Kumachii!! I've finally returned to the 'Lower Realm'!!"
- Comment: wanted to add that Ginny specifically said「下界」, which means earth (lower realm). This is a term first seen in ch. 908, uttered by St. Topman Warcury to refer to the OP world (minus Mary Geoise). Viz also used 'lower realm' as the official translation in that chapter. 

3b. Ginny's speech bubble on top of den-den mushi:

- Original:【いるけど！！】【顔も．．．体も】【全身さ．．．「自然光」を浴びると青く．．．石みたいに皮膚が固まるんだと．．．】
- Meaning: "She's here, but...!!" "Her face... and her body" "Her whole body... when basked in 'natural light,' her skin hardens like stone and turns blue..."

5c. Flashback dialogue bubble on sobbing Kuma close-up:
- TCB Scans: Wouldn't it make you happy?!
- Original: 【幸せにしてやるからよ！！！】
- Meaning: "I'll make you happy!!!"
- Comment: A declarative statement full of conviction as opposed to a question (as explained in section 6a. of the ch. 1097 comparison <https://pastebin.com/G6yuVX1P>).

5d. Sobbing granny speech bubbles (from Kuma hugging Ginny to baby Bonney crying):
- TCB Scans: She burned up her remaining time, exposing herself to the sun, so she could cross the ocean... and make it home to us... because she wanted to ensure her baby's safety.

- TCB Scans: You can rest now, Ginny... I Swear... I'll raise her well.
- Original: 【ジニー安心してくれこの子はおれが育てる】
- Meaning: "Ginny, don't you worry. I will raise this child."

6b. One of the geriatric's reprimanding: 
- TCB Scans: And if you're gonna be sleeping next to her, make sure her cot is like an iron cage!! 
- Original:【寝る時は鉄の檻に！！】
- Meaning: "At bedtime, place her in an iron cage!!" 
- Comment: no mention of a cot, just straight up tells him to put her inside an iron cage.

nothing to comment on.

- Original:【おとといきやがれ！！！クソガキ共っ！！】
- Meaning: "Don't you ever come here again!!! Ya shitty brats!!"
- Comment: If, at 5 years old, she's already flipping them off, wouldn't it make sense that she'd be cursing along, too?

10b. Speech bubbles by the cross:
- TCB Scans: I dare you to take a step out here, you ugly vampire! Eat this!! Bet the Holy Cross is your weakness! Look at it shine!!
- Original:【外に出れねー吸血鬼！！十字架くらえ！！ぴかーーーーっ！！】
- Meaning: "You can't go outside can you, vampire!! Eat this Cross!! Ha!!"
- Comment: no mention of "ugly" or "weakness." The「ぴかーーーーっ！！」("pikaaa!!") is just a battle shout akin to when you play Dragon Ball with each other, shooting ki blasts out of your palms while shouting "HA!!"

11c. 2nd to last panel, surprised Bonney:
- TCB Scans: UWA!
- Original:【こわ！！】
- Meaning: "Scary!!"



12. Page 12: 

12a. Bonney simply asks, "do you know about sky islands?" without mention of 'legendary'

12b. Kuma doesn't mention birthday celebration.



13. Page 13:

13a. Doctor:
- TCB Scans: I'm afraid it's simply terminal, going by our current scientific understanding of it.

13b. 2nd panel Kuma:
- TCB Scans: It'll be over by her 10th birthday...?
- Original:【10歳．．．！？】
- Meaning: "10 years old...!?"

13c. 3nd panel Kuma:
- TCB Scans: This isn't fair... She's already growing into such a strong woman. Is there really no cure?!

- Meaning: "No way... She's already grown so healthily to that extent...!! Is there really no treatment method!?"

13d. Speech bubble below Bonney's wide smile:
- TCB Scans: You said it'll be over by my 10th birthday, right?!
- Original:【10さいって？】
- Meaning: "[What do you mean by] 10 years old?"

13e. Last speech bubble:
- TCB Scans: It's just such an appalling amount of time... I couldn't help but get down after that.
- Original:【そんなにかかるのかって．．．！！私は落ち込んでた所だ！！】
- Meaning: "[I said to him,] Is it really going to take that long!! I just felt so down!!"



14. Page 14:

14a. Bottom right panel:
- TCB Scans: You've got to save us!
- Original:【くまちー助けておくれ！！】
- Meaning: "Kumachii, please save us!!"

14b. Bottom middle panel:
- TCB Scans: King Becori has returned, and he's just as monstrous as ever!!

- Meaning: "King Becori is at it again!!"

14c. Final speech bubble:
- TCB Scans: It's just like 16 years ago! He still wants to cut loose the country's "deadweight!" He's going to burn the people in their homes!
- Original:【１６年前の再来だよ......！！国の足手まといを燃やしちまうんだよ！！！あいつは人間じゃねェ！！人を大量に殺し始めた！！！】
- Meaning: "It's the second coming of what happened 16 years ago......!! He's burning down the country's deadweight!!! He's not human!! He's started to kill a lot of people!!!"
- Comment: "he's not human" was left out. At first, I wanted to not think of and just leave it as a regular exclamation of how awful a person can be, but thinking about it deeper, a lot could have happened in those 16 years, and looking at the scale of disaster happening to Sorbet, maybe something far more sinister is shrouded behind this exclamation.

14d. Closing commentary:
- TCB Scans: The never ending tragedy continues to unfold
- Original:【悪夢は終わらないー】
- Meaning: "A never ending nightmare"
